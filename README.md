# 🚀 Building Intent-Based Advanced Semantic Search

Thrilled to announce the development of an intent-based advanced semantic search system! 🌐✨

## Tech Stack:

- **GPT-3.5 Turbo Model:** Leveraging the power of OpenAI's cutting-edge GPT-3.5 Turbo model, we've embraced the new JSON mode for enhanced interaction and context understanding.

- **Elasticsearch 8.11:** Our search engine is now powered by Elasticsearch version 8.11, providing support for vector dimensions up to 4096. This ensures a robust foundation for efficient data retrieval and analysis.

- **OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 Model:** Incorporating OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model for sophisticated text representation, enabling more nuanced and context-aware semantic search capabilities.
